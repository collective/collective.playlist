Documentation
-------------

Initial playlist
*******************

An initial playlist with tracks is created at /playlist.

The Add-On uses JPlayer_.

Sticky Footer
*************

The site is navigable while the player continues to play thanks to pjax_. Pjax works with browsers that support the history.pushState() API. When the API isn't supported, Pjax goes into fallback mode (and it just does nothing). `Browser Support`_

The sticky footer is shown if and only if a published playlist exists. For a qualified user it's shown anyway.

Pop Up Player
*************

The pop up player is per default deactivated. You can activate it via @@manage-viewlets view like
localhost:8080/Plone/@@manage-viewlets

A play button is shown on top of each page if and only if a published playlist exists. For a qualified user it's shown anyway.

Click the play button to open the player. A menu to edit the playlist and its tracks is presented to qualified users.
