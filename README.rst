Documentation
=============

The Add-On uses JPlayer [#f1]_.

Initial playlist
----------------

An initial playlist with tracks is created at /playlist.

Multiple playlists
------------------

Create additional playlists. The player takes the one with the newest publishing date.

Where are the audio files?
--------------------------

- You can add tracks with audio files to a playlist.
- You can reference audio files with links.
- You can reference external audio files with links via remote url.

Sticky Footer
-------------

The site is navigable while the player continues to play thanks to pjax [#f2]_. Pjax works with browsers that support the history.pushState() API. When the API isn't supported, Pjax goes into fallback mode (and it just does nothing). See Browser Support [#f3]_.

The sticky footer is shown if and only if a published playlist exists. For a qualified user the player is shown even for an unpublished playlist.

Pop Up Player
-------------

The pop up player is per default deactivated. You can activate it via @@manage-viewlets view like
localhost:8080/Plone/@@manage-viewlets

A play button is shown on top of each page if and only if a published playlist exists. For a qualified user it is shown even for an unpublished playlist.
Click the play button to open the player. A menu to edit the playlist and its tracks is presented to qualified users.

===============
